    <p class="bigfont">Isochron, in collaboration with ECCO Leathers, presents our first capsule collection: “Illusions of Lightness.” This concise collection consists of four distinct objects: a ring, optical frames, a sling bag, and a glove, utilizing both sterling silver and cutting-edge technical leathers produced by ECCO Leathers; specifically, FSDX Dyneema and Apparition leather. Although leather is not traditionally utilized in the world of jewelry, we chose this combination of materials to juxtapose their opposing attributes of weight and lightness, while also showcasing their striking similarities in lustre. With the fusing of precious metal and technical leather in this collection, we seek to advance the medium of jewelry through material innovation and design.
